My Full Stack Application
This application is a full stack web application built using Quarkus, PostgreSQL, and ReactJS.

Features
User Registration: Users can create a new account with a unique username and password.
User Login: Users can login to their account using their unique credentials.
JWT Authentication: Implements JWT authentication for secure access to certain parts of the application.
Add Product (Future Feature): In the future, we plan to add functionality for users to add products.
Built With
Back-End: The back-end is built with Quarkus, a full-stack, Kubernetes-native Java framework made for Java virtual machines (JVMs) and native compilation, optimizing Java specifically for containers and enabling it to become an effective platform for serverless, cloud, and Kubernetes environments.

Database: The data persistence is handled by PostgreSQL, a powerful, open-source object-relational database system with over 30 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.

Front-End: The front-end is built with ReactJS, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily for single-page applications. It's used for handling the view layer for web and mobile apps and allows developers to create reusable UI components.

Future Plans
We plan to extend this application by adding new features such as adding, updating, and deleting products.
